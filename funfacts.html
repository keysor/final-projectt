    <h1>I have a few <b>Fun Facts</b> to share with you here!</h1>
    <ul>
      <p><b>Movie</b>: Small story, however when I was 8-9 years old in 2009 I was recorded to be in a movie! I was even given my own IMDB page that states that I'm known for my role in that movie. Called How I Got Lost. I didn't have a speaking part but it's fun to know that I'm listed in the cast and was craeted an IMDB page.</p>
      <p><b>Tiktok</b>: Listen, I don't really like this app, It's a social media app where you can post videos. I posted <b>one</b> video and it went viral. <b>14.5 Million views and 2.5 Million likes on that app alone</b> I saw it being reposted on a few different wesbsites with no credit given however!</p>
